# Archive Digitisation Uploader

## Getting started

Clone the repo and run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

Next you can start the application in development mode using the following command:

```
yarn start
```

> ⚠️ React components will automatically be reloaded when modified. However, if you make changes to the Electron application files (`public/electron.js`, `public/electron/*`) then you'll have to restart the application.

## Build for production

The following command will build a production ready version of the application for your current platform:

```
yarn build
```

If you want to build the application for all platforms (currently macOS and Windows) then use the following command:

```
yarn build-all
```
