# Archive Digitalisation Uploader

## Getting started

Clone the repo and run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

Next you can start the Electron app in development mode using the following command:

```
yarn start
```

All changes made to React components will automatically reload. If you make changes to the Electron application then you'll have to restart the app.

## Build for production

The following command will build a production ready version of the Electron app (concurrently only for macOS):

```
yarn build
```
